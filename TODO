# Pasto TODO

## High Priority

### SSH Server Issues
- [ ] Implement auto-restart mechanism for SSH process when it crashes
- [ ] Investigate Shirk 0.1.2 stability compared to 0.1.0
- [ ] Consider process monitoring with PID tracking and restart logic
- [ ] Add error logging for SSH process crashes

### Cross-Process Coordination Testing
- [ ] Test SSH login → HTTP token validation flow
- [ ] Test concurrent paste creation (SSH + HTTP simultaneously)
- [ ] Verify session persistence across process restarts
- [ ] Test user fingerprint mapping between SSH and web

## Medium Priority

### User Experience
- [ ] Implement user preferences in database instead of cookies/localStorage
- [ ] Add user profile customization options
- [ ] Improve error messages for SSH authentication failures
- [ ] Add session expiration handling

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown handling for both processes
- [ ] Implement rate limiting that works across processes
- [ ] Add health checks for both HTTP and SSH servers
- [ ] Monitor memory usage and potential leaks

## Low Priority

### Features
- [ ] Add SSH command help interface
- [ ] Implement paste expiration with user control
- [ ] Add paste statistics and analytics
- [ ] Support for SSH key management in user profile

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Improve logging with structured output
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Write integration tests for SSH/HTTP coordination

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Review and optimize Sepia storage usage
- [ ] Consolidate theme handling across web and SSH
- [ ] Standardize error response formats
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components
